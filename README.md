# Press Calculator

This is a quickly bootstrapped helper utility designed for nuclear force planning problems in Professor Press's Dartmouth GOVT 50.06 class (Nuclear Weapons). A demo version is accessible [here](https://press-calculator.netlify.app/).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
